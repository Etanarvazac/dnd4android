## Summary
Take your D&D Characters everywhere with your phone! D&D 4 Android will help track all of your characters stats, health, skills, equipment, items, and more with ease! Currently in an adventure? You can also track your character's current standing with the ability to track health, surges, rests, and powers with the tap of a button!

[ NOTE ] You can view the original [Google Play listing here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thomasgallinari.dnd4android&gl=US) and download it on older Android devices. Credits to Thomas for the original.

## Notable Cleanup
- [ ] Android 10+ support (Current max supported version: 7)
- [ ] Page organization (Some things are better on the same page)
- [ ] Skill Additions (Should you improve a skill using a feat or other means, or your campaign has custom skills)
- [ ] Even with the cleanup above, you'll have the option to use the legacy appearance

## Planned Upgrades
- [ ] App customization
  - [ ] Font changes
  - [ ] Themes
  - [ ] Feature toggles (Should you not like a feature D&D 4 Android provides, you'll be able to shut it off)
- [ ] Edition Control (Make it easier to track what characters are for what edition, should you be playing multiple at once)
- [ ] Power & Feat Details (Ever notice how little space physical sheets provide? With this, you won't need to break out the book for your powers or feats!)
- [ ] Auto-UP Level Management
  - [ ] XP (Should you enter the required XP to level up, this will automatically add 1 to your level and convert what XP remains)
  - [ ] Known bonuses (If your race grants a bonus to a skill or attribute upon leveling, you will recieve a prompt if it's a roll, or summary if pre-defined)
  - [ ] Added bonuses (Auto-UP prompt will inform you if you have gained a new feat or power with the new level)
- [ ] Character Sheet Conversion
  - [ ] Need a physical copy? Easily convert your digital sheet to a PDF! You will given the option to change size of the text for anything that can change. Smaller text will be for reference, while normal size will be more permanent.
- [ ] Dice Roller (Should you forget your actual dice and there's none available to borrow, you'll be able to do your rolls in the app)
- [ ] Character Icon & Preview (you'll be able upload two concept arts to each character, first their head (visible in character list), second their entire body)
