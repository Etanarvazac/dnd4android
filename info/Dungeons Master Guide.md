Dungeon Master Guide
====================
Want to create an awesome version of D&D 4 Android for your players? This guide will help you through the process! However, as a recommendation, it is not recommended that you completely change one or more features as this would remove the familiar feel of D&D 4 Android, especially for those with the official version already on their device.

#### Version Control
First and foremost, your players won't be able to install your version if they already have the official version installed. To combat this, you have a few options:
1. Upon completion of your customization, you may submit a request to Etanarvazac Revorix to list your version on an app store as you won't have the signing keys.
2. You can manually make the following changes to the app to install it alongside the official version.

**Android Manafest:**
You will need to change information regarding the app. For starters, the official version's identifier is `com.revorix.dnd4android`. Should this not be changed, your version won't be installable on any device. The recommended approach is change `com` or `revorix` to your handle or nickname. Using Etanarvazac as an example, `etan.revorix.dnd4android` or `com.etan.dnd4android` would be acceptable by the Android OS. To break this format down, `com` is "Company", `revorix` is user or group name, and `dnd4android` is the friendly identifier name. However, you will find most companies use the user or group namespace instead of the Company namespace.

#### Notes
More to this guide will be added over time.
